## ✨ Features

### Always-On (no toggle needed)

**🎯 Crosshair** — cyan crosshair, auto-hides in menus and pause screens

**🎯 Target HUD** — canvas-based HUD at top-center of screen
- **Players** — persistent face + name + health bar. Face cached so it stays visible when looking away
- **Mobs** — clean name (`Zombie`, `Creeper` etc.) + health bar + distance
- **Blocks** — block name + 🧱 icon when no entity is nearby. Entity always takes priority over block
- Health bar color reacts to HP: 🟢 → 🟡 → 🔴

**🌌 Space Sky** — MilkyWay cubemap skybox, replaces the default day/night sky entirely

|---------|-------------|
| 📊 FPS & Ping | Unified counter, color-coded by performance |

## ⚡ Performance

~0.5% total CPU. Key optimizations:
- Game reference cached and revalidated every 2s — never resolved per frame
- Target HUD entity scan throttled to 20fps, dirty flag skips redraws when nothing changed
- Single RAF loop, direct DOM updates, debounced settings saves
- MutationObserver scoped to `#react` only, module panels cached
- Space sky patches `sky.update` directly — zero RAF overhead

---

## 🛡️ Stability

- Target HUD RAF loop is error-bounded — any mid-frame throw resets state and restarts after 2s backoff instead of silently dying
- Space Sky detects whether Miniblox's bundled Three.js is new enough (r128+) before using it; falls back to a pinned CDN build if not, with a toast on failure
- Settings migration strips unrecognised keys from older versions so stale config never breaks new feature state
- Panel cache is invalidated on settings restore so module buttons always reflect the correct saved state

---

## 📝 Changelog

### [6.8] - Stability & Polish
- ⚡ `getGameCached()` — game reference revalidated every 2s instead of every RAF frame
- 🐛 `_panelCache` busted on `restoreSavedState` so module buttons correctly reflect loaded settings
- 🛡️ Three.js version guard in `initSpaceSky` — uses bundled copy only if `REVISION >= 128`, otherwise loads pinned CDN build with `onerror` toast fallback
- 🛡️ Error boundary in `startTargetHUDLoop` — `tick()` wrapped in try/catch; resets draw state and restarts via `setTimeout` to prevent duplicate RAF chains
- 🗂️ Settings versioning — `migrateSettings()` silently drops keys not in the current feature set; `KNOWN_FEATURES` derived automatically from initial state
- ✨ Fun Facts module — penguin fact toast fires once on first game join per session

### [6.5] - Space Sky
- 🗑️ Removed custom health/food/XP overlay — native bars restored
- 🐛 Fixed duplicate interval stacking on realTime and antiAfk rapid toggles
- ✨ Always-on MilkyWay cubemap skybox via Three.js `sky.update` patch

### [6.4] - Target HUD
- ✨ Canvas-based Target HUD — players, mobs, and blocks
- ✨ Player face cached from DOM, persists when looking away
- ✨ Native target HUD hidden and replaced entirely
- ✨ Entity always takes priority over block
- ⚡ Throttled scans, dirty flag, cached gradient

### [6.2] - Architecture Pass
- 🐛 Multiple cleanup, leak and stale reference fixes
- ⚡ MutationObserver scoped, module panels cached, settings debounced

### [6.1] - Reliability Pass
- 🐛 Fixed gameRef, keyDisplay listeners, party request and interval leak bugs

### [6.0] - Advanced API Features
- ✨ CPS detector, chat greeting, toast system, HUD array, session timer, sidebar navigation
